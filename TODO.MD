# Approach:

Initial approach changed, new approach: try open file with rust pass it base 64 to js code âœ…

Now: implement what is in useWindowListeners
- next      (current)
- previous
- first
- last
- save
- new
- open
- 

# To Add

- Message when trying to do something else when one action is currently being executed
- Display a message when an action finished executing (ex: copied file ...)
- 


- Can we display name of file being viewed in the window?


# Ideas for the future



Commands:
- Randomize
- Sort
- 


Menu:
- Pick file type to display: gif, png, jpeg etc
- 


Command + F --> Search
Command + R --> Reverse
Command + P --> Print
Command + L --> Panel to visualize/scroll


Other:
- Replace Vector of types by an enum
- instead of returning base64 data, return the whole gif with metadata, name & title etc;



selected paths: multiple: can return multiple paths?
